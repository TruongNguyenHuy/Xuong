The Typeface
TNH Xuong is a typeface that takes its name and design inspiration from "Xuong Ba La", one of the means of transportation on rivers of people in the southwestern region of Vietnam. I will explain why it has the name "Xuong Ba La": because it is a small boat moving in small rivers in the southwestern provinces, made up of three pieces of wooden planks connected together by wooden splints called "curved bars" in Vietnamese. And in our country, people will use oars also made from wood to move the boat. A special thing is that these things are all handmade by our people, very meticulously and meticulously. That's why I used those special details to form the typeface, the sturdy strokes representing wooden planks connected together. Besides, there is also a roughness that gives a handcrafted feeling similar to the production process of "Xuong Ba La". The TNH Xuong typeface is a sturdy and flexible sans-serif typeface, with identical upper and lower case letters, with the ALLCAPS style used for display and decorative purposes.
